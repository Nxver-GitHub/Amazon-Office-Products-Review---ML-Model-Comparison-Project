# Amazon-Office-Products-Review---ML-Model-Comparison-Project
A project created to compare two ML models (a simple linear regression model and an advanced random forest classification model) to compare metrics of each model for the task of language analysis using Amazon products review in the office category. This project utilizes Jianmo Ni's 2018 Amazon office products "small" data subset file to parse reviews as training data.
